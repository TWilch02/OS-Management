# OS-Management
Simulation of Operating System concepts. Menu-driven, allowing user to pick which algorithm to simulate. Available choices: CPU Scheduling, Race Condition, Banker's Algorithm, Memory Management, Page Replacement, and Disk Scheduling. It’s an educational OS algorithms simulator covering CPU scheduling, synchronization, deadlock avoidance, memory allocation, page replacement, and disk scheduling.

Detailed option breakdown:

CPU Scheduling: Implements First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling, showing waiting time, turnaround time, and averages.

Race Condition: Uses two threads that update a shared resource (resource) to demonstrate how race conditions cause inconsistent results.

Banker’s Algorithm: Simulates the deadlock avoidance algorithm, checking if the system is in a safe state and printing the safe sequence if one exists.

Memory Management: Demonstrates allocation strategies: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit for assigning processes to memory blocks.

Page Replacement: Simulates FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms, showing allocations and page faults.

Disk Scheduling: Implements FCFS and SSTF disk head movement scheduling, printing sequences and total seek time.
